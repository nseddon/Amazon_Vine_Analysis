# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the the correlation between Vine reviews and Non-Vine reviews.  Specifically, the analysis was focused on Video Game products, which was obtained from AWS.  The data was then drilled down into several tables to allow for easy manipulation, without damaging the original data source.  From this, we were able to obtain percentages of both Vine and Non-Vine reviews for products that recieved 5 star reviews.
